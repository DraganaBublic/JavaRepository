# Benchmarking-Java-Sort

## Overview
Benchmark-Sort-Java is a project developed as part of my Computational Thinking module. It serves as a comprehensive benchmarking tool for evaluating and comparing sorting algorithms in Java.

## Sorting Algorithms Benchmark in Java
This Java-based benchmarking tool assesses the performance of various sorting algorithms, providing valuable insights into their behavior under different conditions and input sizes.

## Introduction
Sorting is a foundational operation in computer science, and the selection of a sorting algorithm can significantly influence the efficiency of data processing tasks. The key objectives of this project include:

- Understand the performance characteristics of different sorting algorithms.
- Choose the most appropriate sorting algorithm for specific use cases.
- Visualize and analyze benchmarking results.

## Algorithms Included
The project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort

Each algorithm undergoes thorough benchmarking across various input sizes, offering insights into its efficiency.

## Project Structure
The project is organized with the following directory structure:

- `src/ie/atu/sw`: This directory contains the Java source code for the project.
