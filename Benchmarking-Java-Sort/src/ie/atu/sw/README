Benchmarking-Java-Sort
Benchmark-Sort-Java is a project I completed as part of my module in Computational Thinking. It evaluates and compares sorting algorithms in Java.

Sorting Algorithms Benchmark in Java
This project is a Java-based benchmarking tool for evaluating the performance of various sorting algorithms. It provides insights into how different sorting algorithms perform under various conditions and input sizes.

Introduction
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and the choice of sorting algorithm can significantly impact the efficiency of data processing tasks.

Understand the performance characteristics of different sorting algorithms. Choose the most appropriate sorting algorithm for specific use cases. Visualize and analyze benchmarking results.

Algorithms Included
This project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort Selection Sort Insertion Sort Quick Sort Counting Sort

Each algorithm is thoroughly benchmarked under various input sizes to provide insights into its efficiency.

Project Structure
The project is organized with the following directory structure:
src/ie/atu/sw: This is where the Java source code for the project is located. 

How to Use
